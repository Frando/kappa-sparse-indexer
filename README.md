# kappa-sparse-indexer

An indexer for hypercores with support for sparse indexing and exposing the indexed data to Kappa views.

Based on [an in-progress kappa-core version](https://github.com/kappa-db/kappa-core/pull/14).

See [example.js](example.js) for a full example on how this can be used with [hypercore-query-extension](https://github.com/peermaps/hypercore-query-extension/) and [multifeed](https://github.com/kappa-db/multifeed) to do efficient sparse syncing of collections of hypercores.

More docs to come soon! For now check out the example (will also be expanded soon)
